    "\n",
    "GLIMS data was chosen to serve the purpose of this EDA because it was the most recent(continually updated), reliable, and complete glacier database with global coverage found...\n",
    "\n",
    "Coverage:\n",
    "- extent and rates of change of glaciers\n",
    "- the world's mountain glaciers and ice caps (excluding ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica)\n",
    "- new data continually being added\n",
    "- repeating surveys of the world's estimated 200,000 glaciers\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Sources: \n",
    "- Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument aboard the Terra satellite\n",
    "- LANDSAT series of satellites\n",
    "- historical observations\n",
    "- international contributions from regional glaciological institutions\n",
